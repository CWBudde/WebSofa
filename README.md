# WebSofa
WebSofa is a JavaScript library for reading SOFA files. It is written in Object Pascal, but easily transcompiles to JavaScript using the [Hope](https://github.com/Walibeiro/Hope) command line compiler.

## Disclaimer
The code slightly relates to [libmysofa](https://github.com/hoene/libmysofa). However, it is written from scratch and similarities might only occur from the fact that both are meant for the same purpose and using the same underlying specification.
